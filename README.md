## Overview

Quake sounds binded to Cmd-Shortcuts for Mac. Become **264%** more awesome!

This project has been created on the [ADVANCE Hackathon 2012](http://hackathon.advance-conference.com/) in Cologne, Germany!

#### Todo

* Clean up the code - This is one of my first Objective-C projects and you will see that by reading the code.
* Add functionality to add custom sounds binded to key combinations
* Finder does not seem to accept keyboard events passed over by CmdTournament. Find out why, this might be a good point to start: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6254173/finder-dont-receive-keyboard-event-inside-callback-function](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6254173/finder-dont-receive-keyboard-event-inside-callback-function)
